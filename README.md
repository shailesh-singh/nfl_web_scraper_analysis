# NFL Fantasy Data Analysis using SparkSQL
This repo shows how to use PySpark using Jupyter notebook to extract data from CSV into Spark's RDD and transfrom the RDD into DataFrame for use with SparkSQL. Check out the Jupyter Notebook [QBplayer_progress.ipynb](https://github.com/shailesh-singh/nfl_web_scraper_analysis/blob/master/QBplayer_progress.ipynb) for details.
The data used in this script was extracted from NFL Fantasy website using the [nfl_web_scraper](https://github.com/shailesh-singh/nfl_web_scraper) I created earlier.
